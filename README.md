# Project: Comparison between posit and float representation in a computer vision task using YOLOv5
## Authors: Erica Dallatomasina, Matteo Castrignano

Repository for the project of the course of Symbolic and Evolutionary Artificial Intelligence. 

The YoloV5 repository is modified in order to support the posit numeric format. Modified files are marked by the suffix "_modificato" in the file name.
You can find the official Yolov5 repository at https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 . 

The file tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_util.py is a file from the cpp library that we slightly modified in order to correctly make computations with posit numbers.
